### Arduino Library for I2C Real Time Clock
This paper presents a library for Arduino to interface with the DS3231, a high-precision I2C real time clock (RTC) with an integrated temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) and crystal. The library allows users to set and get the current date and time from the device. The library is based on the hardware datasheet of the DS3231, which provides detailed information on the device's functionality and registers (Analog Devices, 2015). The paper also explains the main functions of the library and how to use them in Arduino sketches.
